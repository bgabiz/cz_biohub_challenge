# 3D Image Fusion for Microscopy Data (Zarr)

This Python script performs 3D image registration between two volumes (views) extracted from a 5D Zarr dataset from DaXi microscope.

The process utilizes **SimpleITK** for the registration algorithm (based on Mutual Information) and **Napari** for an interactive 3D visualization of the final result.

## üéØ Features

* Loads multidimensional data directly from a Zarr file.
* Extracts two specific 3D volumes (views) from a single time point (`T_INDEX`).
* Performs a downsampling pre-processing step to speed up registration.
* Uses the robust SimpleITK registration framework to find a rigid (`Euler3DTransform`) transformation.
* Applies the calculated transform to align the "moving image" (View 1) to the "fixed image" (View 0).
* Launches Napari for an interactive visualization, overlaying the original and aligned images with different colors for easy inspection.
